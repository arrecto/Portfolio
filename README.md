## (Ongoing) Ocular Disease Classification Using Artificial Neural Network ##
This project aims to provide a computer-aided diagnosis for early detection of ocular diseases.
Current progress:
- Created a software application [PERG Viewer](https://github.com/arrecto/PERGViewer) for reading and pre-processing of eye signals.
* Performed initial binary classification (normal vs abnormal) without data filtering using an Artificial neural network and obtained an accuracy of 70-80%.
  
## Analysis of Deforestation and Flight Tracks of Lesser Spotted Eagles(Clanga pomarina) in Latvia ##
This project assesses the correlation between the rate of deforestation in specific areas in Latvia and the probability of eagle's flight track deflection.
-Visualized the flight trajectory of eagles using **MATLAB** geoplot.
*Performed logistic regression using **sci-kit learn** and **statsmodels**.
