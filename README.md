## (Ongoing) Ocular Disease Classification Using Artificial Neural Network
This project aims to provide a computer-aided diagnosis for early detection of ocular diseases.
Current progress:
- Created a software application [PERG Viewer](https://github.com/arrecto/PERGViewer) for reading and pre-processing of eye signals.
* Performed initial binary classification (normal vs abnormal) without data filtering using an Artificial neural network (**keras Tensorflow**) and obtained an accuracy of 70-80%.

This is the graphical user interface of PERG Viewer

## Analysis of Deforestation and Flight Tracks of Lesser Spotted Eagles(Clanga pomarina) in Latvia
This project assesses the correlation between the rate of deforestation in specific areas in Latvia and the probability of eagle's flight track deflection.
-Visualized the flight trajectory of eagles using **MATLAB** geoplot.
*Performed logistic regression using **sci-kit learn** and **statsmodels**.

## Modelling the Spread of Rumor Using the SIR Model##
This project aims to create a model which shows the movement of people from one compartment (ignorant, spreader, or stifler) to another in context to the spread of rumor.
- Solve a differential equation to simulate the movement of rumor.
* Model the differential equation using the **scipy** library by adjusting different parameters.
